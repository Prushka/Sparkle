# Discord Activity Support

Discord recently introduced public developer preview activities.
This site can be added into your custom discord activity in developer portal.
Doing so will use discord OAuth2 for username and profile picture syncing.
Channel id will be used as the room id. All functionalities mentioned above are supported in discord activity.

# This repository contains only the frontend & SSR part

The [backend](https://github.com/Prushka/Sparkle-BE) part is still a work-in-progress.

Currently, this project is intended to be used as an extension to
[Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr)/[Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) and your local media library.

It needs to be self-hosted like certain media players (_e.g.,_ Plex).

Video files are first processed and transcoded by the backend to:

1. Encode the video files to `AV1`, `HEVC`, `H.264` codecs
2. Generate thumbnails (video storyboards for preview) and posters
3. Extract subtitles and audio tracks
4. Locate and extract nfo files
5. Extract dominant theme color from poster
6. Extract and populate chapter timestamps & titles
